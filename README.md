These are the changes I made for my application

I added the ability for the chef to delete individual menu items directly from the main menu.

So each dish now includes a “Delete” button with confirmation prompt to prevent accidental removal.

I added an automatic summary statistics in the main manu section.

Total number of dishes.

Total price of all dishes combined.

Average price on all dishes.

Average price for each category, Starter, Main Course and Dessert

Summary updates dynamically whenever a dish is added or deleted.

I added a dropdown for the summary for a cleaner interface.

I lasly added a filter page as the third page to filter through Main meal, Starter and Dessert.
